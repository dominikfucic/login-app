## My First Project

### Simple Login/Register Node.js App

Client is written with Typescript in React.js. Routing is handled in client with React Router. On backend I'm using Express.js with sqlite3 database and express-session for saving auth sessions.

### Usage

#### Install dependencies

`npm run install`

#### Build client

`npm run build`

#### Start server

`npm run start`

Go to http://localhost:3001
